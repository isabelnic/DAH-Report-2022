# DAH-Report-2022
The suplimentry material for the remote sensing system. A University of Edinburgh 4th year course in finished Dec 2022

## Pupose
 This project uses an Arduino to receive data from three sensors, a humidity, temperature and water level sensor. Using an Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 WiFi micro-controller breakout, the sensors' data is uploaded to the local server that can be accessed by anyone connected to it with the correct IP. This data is then interpreted and analysed by python, which outputs visual representations of the data in graph forms. This data taken by the sensors is also complimented with data from weather stations in Edinburgh, comparing the data taken from the past month - or any month the user chooses.
